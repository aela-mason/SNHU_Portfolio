Retrospective:
  * User needs should be determined through interactions with the client, end users, or
    stakeholders. Stories help by giving these needs a common structure, certain things
    each story must have that help both in querying users for needs and in the team's
    efforts to move stories forward in development.
  * One thing I'll be taking forward into future projects is Test-Driven Development.
    It has really stuck out to me as a process. When I used to be a teacher, rubrics were
    one of my key tools. They ensured that students knew the expectations of each
    assignment, and that the student and I would both score their work the same way.
    That's what TDD feels like to me. It's how I know my code is complete, and it's how
    anyone I'm working with knows what my intent is with a piece of code.
  * Being a good team member in software development is truly about transparency and
    communication. The best programmer in the world will be a detriment to the team if
    they aren't able to convey their needs and their progress to the team, and if they
    aren't able to understand what their team needs from them.
    

Grocery tracking:
  * This program was intended to help a grocery store track the frequency with which they
    were selling specific items, and to be able to prompt the system for that data in a
    couple of different ways.
  * What I did particularly well was creating the interactions between Python and C++.
    I've always really enjoyed file i/o, and so passing data from Python to C++ using
    a file was right up my wheelhouse.
  * The primary place I could enhance my code would be output formatting. What I ended
    up with was a very basic console output. It was nicely formatted, but could definitely
    have been improved with some more attention.
  * What I found most challenging to write were the Python functions. However, it wasn't
    because of the functions themselves. They were actually very straightforward. It was
    because the Python module was being completely unloaded between function calls in the
    provided C++ code. I got past this using robust debugging to finally find the issue,
    since it was presenting as if it were completely different issues.
  * There were a lot of skills in this project that would be transferrable to other
    projects. The one I think I will get the most use out of is just working with two
    languages on the same project. While we had done so before in this course, this was
    the first project where it really felt like I was getting into the weeds of it.
  * I used thorough comments and standardized whitespace to make this program readable.
    I also designed the code in very intentional modular structures to make it easy to
    change or add new functionality as necessary.
